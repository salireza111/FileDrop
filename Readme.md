## FileDrop

I wrote FileDrop because I was tired of swapping USB drives and typing long `scp` commands.

* **Send files or text on your LAN** – drag a file or paste a note and it shows up on any computer running FileDrop.  
* **Fetch files over SSH** – sign in, browse, click to download. Without typing long commands.

Run it on each machine and start moving your stuff.
